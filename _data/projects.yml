    I wrote a book! It's a "Hello, World" tutorial for building products, 
    technologies, and teams in a startup environment. I based it off of my own
    experiences, as well as interviews with programmers from some of the most 
    successful startups of the last decade, including Google, Facebook, 
    LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub, Stripe, Instagram, AdMob, Pinterest, and many 
    others. If you're at all interested in startups, this book is for you.

    A Play Framework project to solve two webpage problems: complexity and 
    performance. To deal with complexity, we build complex webpages by 
    composing smaller pieces. To improve performance, we use HTTP chunked 
    encoding to stream the small pieces to the browser as soon as they are 
    ready, an approach inspired by Facebook's BigPipe.

    I led the project that brought the Play Framework to LinkedIn. Play is a 
    modern web framework that combines the performance and reliability of Java 
    and Scala, the power of reactive programming, and the productivity of full 
    hot reload support.

    Launched a program at LinkedIn that allows any employee to come up with an

    Ran LinkedIn's internal and external hackday program. A hackday is an event
    where you get 24 hours to come up with ideas, form teams, and build rapid
    prototypes (hacks) as a proof of concept. I helped organize LinkedIn's 
    public Intern Hackday, DevelopHer Hackday, and Veterans Hackday events,
    and built all the interactive information and registration pages.
