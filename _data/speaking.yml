    Here's the showdown you've been waiting for: Node.js vs Play Framework. 
    Both are popular open source web frameworks that are built for developer 
    productivity, asynchronous I/O, and the real time web. But which one is 
    easier to learn, test, deploy, debug, and scale? Should you pick Javascript 
    or Scala? The Google v8 engine or the JVM? NPM or Ivy? Grunt or SBT?

     Web pages can get complex and slow. This talk shows how to deal with both
     of these issues by using composition and functional programming in the 
     Play Framework to build complex pages out of simpler parts and how to 
     stream those parts extremely quickly to the browser using a Facebook 
     BigPipe-style approach.
