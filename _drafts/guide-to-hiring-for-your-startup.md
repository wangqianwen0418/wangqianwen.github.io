Choosing the right people is far more important than choosing the right 
product, marketing strategy, tech stack, or coding methodology. That means 
hiring is the most important thing you do. It's also one of the hardest.
In this O'Reilly Webcast, I describe how to hire for your startup, including 
what to look for in a candidate, where to find candidates, how to interview 
them, and how to make an offer they can't refuse. I gave this talk on April 30,
2015, and it's based on my book [Hello, Startup]({{ hello_startup_url }}).
