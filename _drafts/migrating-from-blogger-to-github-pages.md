Around 2007, I created my home page on a free PHP host and a blog on Blogger. 
The two websites have served me well for nearly 8 years, but they were long past
due for an update. Last week, I finally sat down and rebuilt my home page on
top of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), 
and [Basscss](http://www.basscss.com/), merged my blog into it, and launched 
the new [ybrikman.com]({{ site.url }}):

{% include figure.html path="screenshots/ybrikman-homepage-screenshot-small.png" alt=site.url url=site.url %}

I wish I could say it was a quick and painless process, but it wasn't. Coming 
up with a design was easy, but making it work on IE and mobile was painful. 
Learning Jekyll and GitHub Pages was easy, but the fact that GitHub Pages only 
supports a few Jekyll plugins was painful. Learning Basscss was easy, but 
filling in the basic UI elements it's missing was painful. And importing my 
posts from Blogger to Jekyll was easy, but making them look nice, and 
redirecting from Blogger to GitHub pages without losing SEO rank was painful. 
In short, just like every
[ground-up rewrite](http://onstartups.com/tabid/3339/bid/97052/How-To-Survive-a-Ground-Up-Rewrite-Without-Losing-Your-Sanity.aspx),
it took much longer than I expected.

As documentation for myself in the future, and as a guide for anyone else 
thinking of doing a similar migration, I've written this blog post to capture 
the key steps involved:

1. [Design](#design)
1. [Code](#code)
1. [Migrate](#migrate)

<a name="design"></a>

## Design

In the spirit of [dogfooding](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food),
I followed the design chapter in my own [book]({{ site.hello_startup_url }}?ref=migrate-blogger-github)
to see if it would lead me to a nice design. One of the key lessons there is
*design re-use*. Just as a programmer should prefer building on top of existing, 
battle-tested, and preferably open source libraries instead of reinventing the 
wheel, a designer should prefer using existing, battle-tested, and preferably 
open source designs instead of coming up with something from scratch. I browsed 
through my list of [design resources]({{ site.hello_startup_url }}/resources/design/?ref=migrate-blogger-github),
and found two free, open source templates to use as a starting point:

1. [Kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper)
1. [Pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll)

I then added a menu based on the 
[Freelancer Bootstrap Template](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/),
a comments and footer section inspired by [Medium](https://medium.com/), and the
simplest favicon I could think of (my initials) generated using
[favicon-generator.org](http://www.favicon-generator.org/). Copy and paste may 
strike some people as an uninspiring way to come up with a design, but the 
truth is that copy, transform, and combine are the basis of *all* creative work, 
as beautifully captured in the 
[Everything is a Remix](http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/) video
series:

{% include iframe-figure.html url="https://player.vimeo.com/video/14912890" caption="Everything is a Remix" link="http://everythingisaremix.info/watch-the-series/" %}

I ended up with a nice clean design, but once I started testing it in Internet
Explorer (IE) and on mobile, I ran into a number of issues. Internet Explorer,
at least the older versions, is problematic because, well, because 
[IE](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/subcultures/internet-explorer) 
[is](http://whyiesucks.blogspot.com/) 
[terrible](http://www.ihateinternetexplorer.com/):

{% include image.html path="blog/github-pages/browsers.jpg" alt="Browsers" %}

Therefore, I've minimally tested my website in the latest IE, and everything
less than version 10 is probably broken (which is OK, since that's less than 
0.5% of my visitors). Mobile is tricky because of the insane number of screen 
sizes you have to support. For example, these are just the screen sizes for 
Android back in 2012:

{% include figure.html path="blog/github-pages/screen-sizes.png" caption="Android fragmentation" url="http://opensignal.com/reports/fragmentation.php" %}

The situation has only gotten worse in the last several years. All I can say is
you need to start practicing [responsive web design](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/layouts/rwd-fundamentals/)
and get really good at using the 
[Device Mode and Emulation](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode)
in Google Chrome:

{% include figure.html path="blog/github-pages/chrome-device-mode.png" caption="Google Chrome Device Mode and Emulation" url="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/device-mode" %}

<a name="code"></a>

## Code

Let's now turn our attention to the code. The primary technologies I'll focus 
on are:

1. [Jekyll](#jekyll)
1. [GitHub Pages](#github-pages)
1. [Styling](#styling)
1. [Components](#components)

<a name="jekyll"></a>

### Jekyll

In 2007, when I first joined Blogger, it was a fairly cutting-edge blogging 
platform. Today, it feels downright dated. It loads slowly, the available 
designs are uninspiring and cluttered, the templates are coded in an arcane XML 
syntax (more on that in the [migrate section](#migrate)), and the in-browser 
writing and editing experience is awful (several times, I've accidentally 
deleted something and it auto-saved, with no revision history to recover). I 
played around with WordPress, Medium, and a number of other blogging platforms, 
but I found all of them too limiting, especially in terms of controlling the 
design and including arbitrary code. Therefore, instead of a hosted blogging 
platform, I decided to try to build my blog on top of 
[Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

Jekyll is a static website generator. There are no databases, web frameworks, 
or complicated Content Management Systems (CMS) to deal with. You just create 
pages in HTML, [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), and
[Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid), and Jekyll compiles them for you 
into a completely static website that consists of plain HTML files. You can 
think of it as a preprocessor for HTML in the same way that 
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is a preprocessor for CSS and 
[CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) is a preprocessor for JavaScript. For 
example, to create a new blog post, you could put a markdown file such as 
`my-new-blog-post.md` into the `_posts` folder:

{% highlight text %}
---
layout: post
title: Blog post title
---  

This is my new blog post.
{% endhighlight %}

The section delimited by `---` at the top of `my-new-blog-post.md` is a block of
YAML called the [Front Matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) that 
tells Jekyll to process this file. The `layout: post` line tells Jekyll to 
stitch the contents of `my-new-blog-post.md` into the layout defined in 
`_layouts/post.html`:

{% highlight html %}
<html>
  <head>
    <title>{% raw %}{{ page.title }}{% endraw %}</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/main.css">
  </head>
  <body>
    <main>
      {% raw %}{{ content }}{% endraw %}
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
{% endhighlight %}

The `{% raw %}{{ XXX }}{% endraw %}` syntax is a variable lookup, so 
`{% raw %}{{ page.title }}{% endraw %}` will be replaced by the title of the 
blog in your Front Matter ("Blog post title") and 
`{% raw %}{{ content }}{% endraw %}` will be replaced by the contents of the 
actual blog post ("This is my new blog post"). Since you have full access to the 
[Liquid template language](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid), you can build 
your website with variables, layouts, includes, for loops, and lots of other 
features that keep your code DRY. And since the output is completely static, 
you can host it anywhere, such as 
[Amazon S3](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html), 
[DropBox](http://learn.andrewmunsell.com/learn/jekyll-by-example/dropbox-hosting),
or the host that I chose, [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

<a name="github-pages"></a>

### GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages allows you to deploy your code to the github.io domain (you can also 
[set up a custom domain](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-github-pages/),
as I did with ybrikman.com) just by pushing your code to a public GitHub repo. 
For example, the repo for ybrikman.com is 
[{{ site.website_repo_url }}]({{ site.website_repo_url }}), and every time I 
`git push` changes there, GitHub automatically runs Jekyll to compile the
site, and deploys the new files. 

The only downside is that GitHub Pages supports only 
[a few Jekyll Plugins](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-plugins-with-github-pages/).
You can use other Jekyll plugins on your local computer and check the compiled
files in, but I've always found that error-prone, so for now, I'm trying to 
work around the lack of plugins as follows:

1. **Assets**: Instead of using 
   [jekyll-assets](https://github.com/jekyll-assets/jekyll-assets), I'm 
   using Jekyll's [native support for sass](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/) 
   to compile, concatenate, and minify my CSS. I have very little JS on the 
   site, and what little is there is already minified and concatenated into
   one small file.
1. **Tags**: Instead of using [jekyll-categories](https://github.com/zroger/jekyll-categories)
   to generate tag pages for my blog posts, I just have a single page with all 
   of my [tags](http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/tags/). The tags page required 
   a little bit of a hack to generate, so check out the code in
   [writing/tags/index.html](https://github.com/brikis98/yevgeniy-brikman-homepage/blob/gh-pages/writing/tags/index.html)
   if you want to do something similar.
1. **RSS**: [jekyll-rss-feeds](https://github.com/snaptortoise/jekyll-rss-feeds)
   works great with GitHub Pages to generate an RSS feed. No hacks required!

<a name="styling"></a>

### Styling

I use [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) for most of my projects because
it provides a great set of default styles, a nice grid system, and a large 
number of reusable UI elements and behaviors. However, I've never been a fan of
how Bootstrap organizes its CSS and markup, and found that small changes often
break my websites in unexpected ways. As a way to learn something new, I 
decided to try [Basscss](http://www.basscss.com/) for my homepage redesign. 
Basscss is loosely based on [Object Oriented CSS](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/)
(OOCSS), which, in theory, makes your CSS more maintainable and reusable. For 
example, in the past, to put together the page that lists all of my
[blog posts](http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/), with a thumbnail on the 
left and the blog post description on the right, I might have written the 
following HTML:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="blog-post">
  <div class="thumbnail">
    <img src="thumbnail.jpg">
  </div>
  <div class="description">
    <p>Description...</p>
  </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

And I would have had the following CSS to go with it:

{% highlight css %}
.blog-post {
  padding: 10px;  
}

.blog-post .thumbnail {
  float: left;
  padding: 20px;
}

.blog-post .description {
  float: left;
  padding: 20px;
  font-size: 16px;
}
{% endhighlight %}

This CSS is not particularly reusable. It'll work for the list blog posts, but 
not for other similar lists, such as my list of 
[projects](http://www.ybrikman.com/projects/), which also has a thumbnail on
the left and a description on the right. Of course, I could make the 
CSS class names more generic, such as replacing `.blog-post` with `.media-item`,
but now the HTML and CSS for both pages is tightly coupled. What if the 
projects list needs to have more padding or use a different font or has slightly
different markup? Now I'd have to insert all sorts of CSS overrides, which make 
it much harder to reason about and maintain the CSS.

The approach in Basscss is, as much as possible, to define small, granular, 
immutable (so you don't override them!), and therefore, highly reusable CSS 
classes. Here's a rough example of the CSS:

{% highlight css %}
/* Reusable classes for padding */
.p1 { padding: 10px; }
.p2 { padding: 20px; }
.p3 { padding: 30px; }

/* Reusable float utilities */
.left { float: left; }
.right { float: right; }

/* Reusable font utilities */
.h1 { font-size: 28px; }
.h2 { font-size: 24px; }
.h3 { font-size: 20px; }
.h4 { font-size: 16px; }
{% endhighlight %}

I can toss these reusable CSS classes into my HTML as follows:

{% highlight html %}
<div class="p1">
  <div class="left p2">
    <img src="thumbnail.jpg">
  </div>
  <div class="left p2 h4">
    <p>Description...</p>
  </div>
</div>
{% endhighlight %}

I could use the same markup in both the blog and project lists. If I wanted more 
padding in the projects list, I would change the `p1` to a `p2`; if I wanted a 
different font, I would change the `h4` to an `h3`; in either case, since the
CSS classes are simple and immutable, I can be confident in making those changes
because it's unlikely they will have any effect on the blog post list. In other
words, this approach makes it *much* easier to reason about style changes, at
least in the short time I've used it so far. The only downside is you end up 
with many more CSS classes in your markup, which does feel slightly verbose and 
repetitive, but the tools for dealing with this in markup (i.e. a templating
language) are much better than in CSS, so it seems like a reasonable trade-off.
Of course, what I've shown above is only a taste of how Basscss works (check out 
their [design principles](http://www.basscss.com/docs/reference/principles/) for 
more info), but so far, I'm pretty happy with the approach.

What I'm less happy with is that Basscss is a minimal and fairly low-level 
framework, so it does not have support built-in for nearly as many UI elements 
and behaviors as Bootstrap (side note: if you're looking for an open 
source project, I'd love to see Bootstrap rewritten on top of Basscss). As a 
result, I've had to do more work to find and glue together libraries that fill 
in the missing UI components.

<a name="components"></a>

### UI Components

Here's a quick list of a few of other UI libraries I used:

1. [responsive-nav.js](https://github.com/viljamis/responsive-nav.js): A nav 
   that collapses down to the "hamburger icon" on mobile. Bootstrap has this
   built-in, and I didn't appreciate some of the difficulties involved until
   I tried to reproduce it manually with Basscss. After struggling for a while,
   I found this library handled it much better.
1. [hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/): Simple popover effects when you
   mouse over text or an image. I could have built this from scratch, but this
   small library handles all the positioning, z-index, transitions, and other 
   trickiness for me.
1. [lazysizes](https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes): A lazy loader that 
   significantly speeds up page load time by only rendering images and iframes
   when (and if) they scroll into view. Very easy to use and it makes a huge
   difference in load time, especially for image and iframe heavy blog posts
   such as [Must-See Tech Talks for Every Programmer](http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2014/05/29/must-see-tech-talks-for-every-programmer/).
1. [Disqus](https://disqus.com/websites/): Add a few lines of JavaScript to
   your page and you have a full-fledged commenting system. It's free, fits 
   well into most UI's, and has great moderation tools to fight spam.
