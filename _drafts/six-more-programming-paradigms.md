About a year ago, I wrote a blog post called
[Six Programming Paradigms That Will Change How You Think About Coding](http://www.ybrikman.com/writing/2014/04/09/six-programming-paradigms-that-will/)
that, despite the hate I got for the clickbait title, still hit the front
page of Hacker News, r/programming, and got hundreds of thousands of page views.
Today, after reading about a bunch more interesting programming paradigms, I'm
publishing the sequel, complete with an even more clickbaity title: 

**Six *More* Programming Paradigms That Will Change How You Think About Coding. 
Number Four Will Shock You!**

Just as in the last post, these are programming paradigms most programmers 
haven't heard of. I love to read about them, but I claim no expertise in any of 
them, so feel free to leave comments with any corrections or suggestions for 
other paradigms that I didn't cover. Enjoy!
