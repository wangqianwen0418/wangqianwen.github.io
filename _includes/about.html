      I am studying interactive data visualization within the broad context of human-computer interaction.
      <!-- I envision interactive data visualiation as an effective approach for knowledge communication. -->
      My work strives to facilitate the communication between humans and machine learning models through 
      creating interactive visual analysis systems.
