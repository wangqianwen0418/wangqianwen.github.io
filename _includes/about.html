  Hello there! I'm <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}">Yevgeniy (Jim) Brikman</a>. 
  I'm currently writing a book called 
  <a href="{{ hello_startup_url }}?ref=ybrikman-home">Hello, Startup</a>,
  which is a programmer's guide to building products, technologies, and teams
  (see <a href="/writing">writing</a>). In the past, I got my BS and Masters in 
  Computer Science at Cornell University, and worked as a software engineer for 
  LinkedIn, TripAdvisor, Cisco Systems, and Thomson Financial (see 
  <a href="{{ site.linkedin_url }}">LinkedIn</a>).
