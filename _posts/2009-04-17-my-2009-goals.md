I meant to post these a long time ago, but somehow never got around to it. 
Anyways, I figure better late the never. Here is the long list of goals I hope 
to accomplish in 2009 as I continue to do 
[Crossfit](http://www.crossfit.com/). Some of these are a hell of a stretch, 
some should be easy, and others are total unknowns. All of them, though, are 
nice concrete numbers to aim for, which should provide some great motivation, 
accountability and something fun to look at in December.

<span style="font-size:78%;">** Indicates that I have not attempted a PR in 
the last year, so the numbers are estimates based on similar performances in 
training (e.g. 5RM, runs of similar distance, etc).* 


So, there you have it. I think I have my work cut out for me. I love the range 
of abilities represented by these goals: strength, power, endurance, stamina, 
balance, coordination, speed and so on. The ["What is 
Fitness?"](http://journal.crossfit.com/2002/10/what-is-fitness-by-greg-glassm.tpl) 
article says it best: 

<blockquote>Our fitness, being “CrossFit”, comes through molding men and women 
that are equal parts gymnast, Olympic weightlifter, and multi-modal sprinter 
or “sprintathlete.”
