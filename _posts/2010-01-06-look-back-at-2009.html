What a year it has been. I moved to CA, joined CF Sunnyvale, resolved to try to qualify for the CF Games, and got myself into the best shape of my life. I had fun going through my <a href="http://forums.anandtech.com/showthread.php?t=194624">workout journal</a> and seeing some of the improvements I've made:<br /><br />Squat: 315 --&gt; 405<br />OH Press: 165 --&gt; 195<br />Deadlift: 405 --&gt; 455<br />OH Squat: 165 --&gt; 205<br />Power clean: 215 --&gt; 265<br />Snatch: 135 --&gt; 195<br />Consecutive kipping pull-ups: 30 --&gt; 40<br />Consecutive air squats: 50 --&gt; 100<br />Consecutive sit-ups: 60 --&gt; 100<br />Fran: 5:58 --&gt; 3:20<br />Murph: 40:01 --&gt; 32:29<br />Cindy: 22+ rounds --&gt; 28 rounds<br />Angie: 22:04 --&gt; 16:28<br /><br /><b>2009 goals: how did I do?</b><br /><br />Looking at my 2009 goals, they can be broken down into 4 categories:<br /><br /><u>Success</u><br />Squat 365, deadlift 455, press 195, 1000lb CFT, OH squat 205, snatch 185, clean 275, 40 consecutive pull-ups, 100 consecutive sit-ups, 100 consecutive air squats, 3:00 Fran, 28 round Cindy<br /><br /><u>Did not attempt</u><br />315 bench press, 100 consecutive push-ups, split jerk 250, 150lb weighted pull-up, King Kong<br /><br /><u>Failure</u> <br />Run 400m in 1:00, run 800m in 2:30, run 1600m in 5:45, run 5000m in 20:00, Murph in 30:00<br /><br />Looking at the above, the pattern is pretty clear: my <a href="http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2009/07/crossfit-strengthpower-hybrid.html">CF strength/power hybrid routine</a> did a great job of developing strength, power, muscular endurance and conditioning in interval/circuit style CF workouts. There were a few items that I never attempted due to a shoulder injury (bench press, push-ups, split jerk) or a lack of equipment (don't have a dip belt for weighted pull-ups and I was supposed to try King Kong this week, but don't have access to bumper plates). Finally, I failed on all the tasks that involved primarily monostructural cardio - in particular, running. <br /><br /><b>Treadmills are evil</b><br /><br />I think a lot of my troubles with running can be attributed to over-reliance on treadmills, which caused a number of issues:<br /><br />1. POSE technique on a treadmill is different than outside so I have a lot of form errors to fix. This is probably the biggest issue.<br /><br />2. I never learned what different running speeds "feel" like since the treadmill controlled the speed for me and now I often run too fast or too slow outside.<br /><br />3. I never developed the mental toughness to maintain a difficult pace and often slow down without the treadmill's constant speed to keep pushing me.<br /><br />4. I thought my times were better than they really were as running on a treadmill is a lot easier.<br /><br /><b>Looking to 2010</b><br /><br />The good news is that my weaknesses are now clear and I know what I need to do in the coming year to eliminate them. I should be able to run outside a whole lot more in CA, so I'm going to try to fit in more monostructural cardio (running and rowing) a few times per week until my technique, pacing and mental toughness improve. Given how much I hate running - which, of course, is probably the biggest reason of all why I suck at it - my workout plan for the next few months can be summarized as:<br /><br />"Beatings will continue until morale improves."<br /><br />Will I improve enough to stand a chance at the CF Games sectional qualifier? Meh, probably not, but it'll be fun as hell to try.
