<b>This is your life. And it's ending one minute at a time.</b> <br /><br />I was watching Fight Club the other day for probably the 30th time and one particular scene really stuck with me. On a rainy night, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is recklessly driving a car with the Narrator (Ed Norton) in the passenger seat and a few members of Project Mayhem in the back. As he steers the car into oncoming traffic and accelerates, Tyler asks:<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.epltalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/fight-club.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="235" src="http://www.epltalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/fight-club.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">What would you wish you'd done before you died?</td></tr></tbody></table><b>Tyler</b>: Guys, what would you wish you'd done before you died?<br /><b>Ricky</b>: Paint a self-portrait.<br /><b>Mechanic</b>: Build a house.<br /><b>Tyler</b>: [to Narrator] And you?<br /><b>Narrator</b>: I don't know. Turn the wheel now, come on!<br /><b>Tyler</b>: You have to know the answer to this question! If you died right now, how would you feel about your life?<br /><b>Narrator</b>: I don't know, I wouldn't feel anything good about my life, is that what you want to hear me say? Fine. Come on!<br /><b>Tyler</b>: Not good enough. <br /><br />It occurred to me that, faced with the same question, I couldn't instantly come up with an answer. And that's sad. Although I painstakingly worked out my <a href="http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2010/01/my-2010-crossfit-goals.html">fitness goals</a>, I somehow had not done the same for any of my other goals. I routinely shake my head at people who head to the gym with no clear purpose defined, but to a large extent, I've gone about my whole life that way. I figured it was time for a change.<br /><br /><b>What would you wish you'd done before you died?</b><br /><ol><li>Visit every continent.</li><li>Sky dive.</li><li>Write a book.</li><li>Deadlift 500lbs.</li><li>Run a 5 minute mile.</li><li>Clean and Jerk 315lbs.</li><li>Run 400m in 55 seconds.</li><li>Do a planche push-up.</li><li>Dunk a basketball.</li><li>Do a backflip. </li><li>Become a recognizable name in the software/CS field.</li><li>Go into outer space and look down at the curvature of planet earth from above.</li><li>Survive for one month like a caveman: that is, live alone in a forest with no modern technologies or comforts.</li></ol>So, that's it for now. Some of these goals I may accomplish within a year or two; others,  perhaps never at all. It doesn't matter, so long as I try.
