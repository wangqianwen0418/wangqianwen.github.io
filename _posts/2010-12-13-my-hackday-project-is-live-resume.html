Last Friday, I got my first project up on LinkedIn Labs: <a href="http://resume.linkedinlabs.com/">Resume Builder</a>. This little app will take your LinkedIn profile and convert it into a beautiful resume. You just sign in with your LinkedIn account, pick from one of the many resume templates, customize what sections are visible and their order, and then print &amp; share to your heart's content. Some samples: <a href="http://resume.linkedinlabs.com/100001">sample 1</a>, <a href="http://resume.linkedinlabs.com/100002">sample 2</a>, <a href="http://resume.linkedinlabs.com/100003">sample 3</a>.<br /><br />The Resume Builder was my first hackday project: it won "most likely to launch" back in March, 2010. What motivated me was the frustration of maintaining my "professional profile" in multiple places. I had Word and PDF documents all over my computer, my <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jbrikman">LinkedIn profile</a>, <a href="http://www.ybrikman.com/">my homepage</a>, etc. Every time I needed to send my resume somewhere, I wasted hours searching for the latest one and often times had to resort to some old version that I tracked down in my gmail "sent mail" folder. Once I joined LinkedIn, I figured it was time to keep my professional data in one place and produce all other formats from it, and I tested this idea out as a hackday.<br /><br />The reaction to my hackery was very positive, and while it took me a while to get around to it, the Resume Builder has finally been converted into a fully functional app. The best part was that it gave me the opportunity to learn and play with a number of "best of breed" technologies: Ruby on Rails, jQuery, Compass, SASS, the LinkedIn APIs, and Markdown. Naturally, these are all part of <a href="http://resume.linkedinlabs.com/6xgq14">my resume</a> now.<br /><br />I created the&nbsp;<a href="http://liresume.blogspot.com/2010/12/features-and-bugs.html">Resume Builder Blog</a>&nbsp;to track updates to the project as well as the <a href="http://liresume.ideascale.com/">Resume Builder IdeaScale community</a> to give users a chance to leave feedback, report bugs, and vote ideas up and down. If you have some time, give the <a href="http://resume.linkedinlabs.com/">Resume Builder</a> a try and let me know what you think!
