I almost forgot to post this tale, but I recently ran across the relevant photos on my phone and knew I had to write something.<br /><br />A few months ago, in preparation for a trip up to Sonoma, Molly and I were at the Stanford Library to pick out a few books. Susan's house in Healdsburg is one of the few places I actually take the time to read, as opposed to listening to audiobooks; after a day of biking, wine tasting and swimming, there is nothing better than relaxing by the pool with a good story. Except the massages. But that's a different story.<br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xLeJxkd63Rs/S9kUjBihQWI/AAAAAAAAIE0/b0m2nbIEyBM/s1600/IMG_7521.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xLeJxkd63Rs/S9kUjBihQWI/AAAAAAAAIE0/b0m2nbIEyBM/s320/IMG_7521.JPG" width="240" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">The pool</td></tr></tbody></table>I keep track of all the books I read - and all the books I want to read - on <a href="http://books.livingsocial.com/people/1716910290">Visual Bookshelf</a>, so I had my list ready when we got to the library. I found the nearest computer and began to search. First up was Richard Dawkins'&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Selfish-Gene-Richard-Dawkins/dp/0192860925">The Selfish Gene</a>. They had a copy, but it seemed to be on hold. Next up:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Pragmatic-Programmer-Journeyman-Master/dp/020161622X">The&nbsp;Pragmatic&nbsp;Programmer</a>. Somebody already had it out. I then tried <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Xenocide-Ender-Book-Orson-Scott/dp/0812509250">Xenocide</a>, the 3rd book in the Ender's Game series. They had it! I wrote down the call number and headed down to the stacks with Molly.<br /><div><br /></div><div>20 minutes later, we came back to the terminal empty handed. The book was nowhere to be found. I continued searching. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Island-Perennial-Classics-Aldous-Huxley/dp/0060085495">The Island</a>? Out. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Girl-Who-Kicked-Hornets-Nest/dp/1906694176">The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest</a>? Lost. I tried a few more and finally got a hit for <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Solitude-Gabriel-Garcia-Marquez/dp/0060929790">One Hundred Years of Solitude</a> in another library. We wandered over there and, sure enough, it was missing from the shelves. How could this be? A world class library and I can't find a single thing to read? Close to giving up, I decided to look up one final book: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flatland-Romance-Dimensions-Thrift-Editions/dp/048627263X">Flatland</a>. It was available, but hidden away somewhere in the basement. Expecting more failure, we headed down.</div><div><br /></div><div>We found ourselves in a large room with a dark red carpet, low&nbsp;ceilings&nbsp;with exposed pipes jutting out and sliding stacks. We followed the call number to the proper shelf and, to our great astonishment, the book was there!</div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xLeJxkd63Rs/TQ3h9jpmdLI/AAAAAAAAJAY/n5BPoBkQnmg/s1600/photo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_xLeJxkd63Rs/TQ3h9jpmdLI/AAAAAAAAJAY/n5BPoBkQnmg/s320/photo.jpg" width="240" /></a></div><div><br /><div>Success! I was just about to head out when one of the pages caught my attention. I opened the book up to take a closer look and this is what I found:</div></div><div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xLeJxkd63Rs/TQ3h8672RdI/AAAAAAAAJAQ/ysa0FfNOc2o/s1600/IMG_0001.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xLeJxkd63Rs/TQ3h8672RdI/AAAAAAAAJAQ/ysa0FfNOc2o/s320/IMG_0001.JPG" width="240" /></a></div><div><br /></div><div>Scribbles. I flipped the page and found more scribbles. I flipped through the whole thing and it was nothing but jagged lines. Every. Single. Page. At this point, I was sure that I had lost my mind. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perchance_to_Dream_(Batman:_The_Animated_Series)">Perchance to Dream</a>&nbsp;anyone?</div><div><br /></div><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xLeJxkd63Rs/TQ3h9AGnqiI/AAAAAAAAJAU/lfLpIpKZjic/s1600/photo+%25281%2529.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_xLeJxkd63Rs/TQ3h9AGnqiI/AAAAAAAAJAU/lfLpIpKZjic/s320/photo+%25281%2529.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Molly captured on camera the split second when I totally, utterly cracked.</td></tr></tbody></table><div>As it turns out, instead of the real Flatland by Edwin A. Abbott, I had stumbled across some modern art/poetry thing with the exact same title. The "author" explains on his <a href="http://www.littleredleaves.com/LRL1/beaulieu.html">webpage</a>:</div><blockquote><div class="style3" style="-webkit-border-horizontal-spacing: 5px; -webkit-border-vertical-spacing: 5px; font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">For each page of Abbott’s novel I have traced, by hand, a representation of each letter’s occurrence across every page of text. The generated result is a series of superimposed seismographic images which reduce the text in question into a &nbsp;two-dimensional schematic reminiscent of EKG results or stock reports.</div></blockquote>How the hell does this crap get published? Why did Stanford buy it? WHY?<br /><br />I left the library that day without a book and quite shaken by the experience. Fortunately, time heals all wounds. Time, and a nice bottle of wine.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xLeJxkd63Rs/S9kUZ7jk1UI/AAAAAAAAICI/MsQdKmEwtwI/s1600/IMG_7367.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="112" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_xLeJxkd63Rs/S9kUZ7jk1UI/AAAAAAAAICI/MsQdKmEwtwI/s400/IMG_7367.JPG" width="400" /></a></div>
