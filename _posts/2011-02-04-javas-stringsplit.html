Just ran into a "gotcha" in Java that had me scratching my head. I had a string of the form "abc.def.ghi" and I wanted to split it on the dot (".") character. So I had the following code:<br /><br /><blockquote>String test = "abc.def.ghi";<br />String[] parts = test.split(".");</blockquote><br />Pop quiz: what does the <i>parts</i> array contain?<br /><br /><ul><li>Did you say {"abc", "def", "ghi"}? Sorry, no.&nbsp;</li><li>Maybe {"abc.def.ghi"}? Nope.&nbsp;</li><li>"Oh, I got it!" you think, and happily announce the solution is {"a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i"}. Bad news, friend: you are still wrong.</li></ul><div>The real solution? parts = {}. That's right, <i>parts </i>is&nbsp;an empty array.</div><div><br /></div><div>Huh?</div><div><br /></div><div>Let's start by looking at the&nbsp;<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/lang/String.html#split(java.lang.String)">API Docs for String's split function</a>. The first thing to realize is that the parameter it takes is a <i>regular expression</i>, and in regex syntax, the dot matches any non-whitespace character. So instead of matching the dots like I wanted, I was matching everything in the string. To actually match a dot character, I needed to escape it with backslashes: test.split("\\.").&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>That's a simple enough error, but why would it result in an empty array? If the dot matches every character, shouldn't I have gotten an array where each character is a separate entry? That certainly <i>feels</i>&nbsp;like the right answer for anyone used to matching things with regex, but we have to remember the regex plays a slightly different role in the split function: it's the <i>delimiter</i>. It's the value on which to split the String and is NOT included in the resulting array.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>So my delightful code snippet ended up matching every character in the input ... and then throwing it away. A fun example of simple code that looks right, but isn't. &nbsp;</div>
