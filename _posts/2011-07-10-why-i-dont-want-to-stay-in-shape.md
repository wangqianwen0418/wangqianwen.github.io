I've been doing [Crossfit for 3 years 
now](http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2008/12/tribute-to-crossfit.html). It has 
gotten me in the best shape of my life in every aspect of fitness: strength, 
speed, endurance, coordination, etc. It has taught me toughness, 
[consistency](http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2011/07/30-day-blog-fitness-challenge.html), 
and that even a 12-hour-per-day desk jockey can occasionally feel like 
superman.

Several months ago, things at work got busy. Very busy. I was taking on "side 
projects" like crazy (see my [programming 
lessons](http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2011/07/programming-lessons-i-wish-i-knew-when.html) 
blog post to see why) and given that there are only 24 hours in a day, some of 
the ones normally dedicated to working out, were instead spent in the office. 
It was at this point I decided to drop my [fitness 
goals](http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2011/01/2011-goals.html) for the year and 
instead focus on just *staying in shape*. 

It turned out to be a big mistake. 

Fitness is all about consistency. Consistency is all about motivation. And 
nothing kills motivation like merely trying to "stay" in shape. You know why?* 
Because the best possible outcome is that nothing changes.* 

That's right: if you are spectacularly successful at staying in shape, you 
quite literally accomplish nothing. You're running in place, spinning your 
wheels and in the absolute best of circumstances, you go nowhere. Of course, 
many people fall short of their fitness goals, which means they actually go 
backwards. Take a moment to absorb that: by setting "staying in shape" as your 
goal, you are at best accepting "no progress" and at worst, end up weaker than 
you started. What kind of workout plan is that? I lost some of my drive, 
passion and working out just wasn't the same.

back to [my goals for this 
year](http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2011/01/2011-goals.html). If I have less 
time to workout, then I'll just need to cut the scope down a bit: fewer goals, 
more focus. And the best part: with this approach, the *worst* case scenario 
is that I stay exactly where I am; in the best case, I actually hit my goals. 
No matter what, I'll have something real to aim for and PR's along the way to 
keep me going.
