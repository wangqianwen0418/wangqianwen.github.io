<span style="font-size: small;">I love traveling to Europe. I've been to 
France, Spain, Austria, Germany, Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and 
Holand. I love [gothic

and [the

Crossing the Atlantic has been our annual summer getaway and I look forward to 
it every year. 

<span style="font-size: small;">However, there are a few things that Europe 
absolutely, positively sucks at. They are mostly small things, conveniences 
I've grown used to in the US that I miss while abroad. So, my dear European 
reader(s), take note and spread the word. I have a trip planned to France this 
August and if you could get these fixed by then, I'd be most greatful. 

## <span style="font-size: large;">1. Shower curtains 
<span style="font-size: small;"> 
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" 
class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; 
text-align: center;"><td style="text-align: center;">[<img border="0" 
height="320" 
src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-46G-fdjdKpM/So2UMV5vCtI/AAAAAAAAFzo/IXF2_1arbsU/s320/IMG_4682.JPG" 
width="240" 
/>](http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-46G-fdjdKpM/So2UMV5vCtI/AAAAAAAAFzo/IXF2_1arbsU/s1600/IMG_4682.JPG)<td 
class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">No shower curtain.<span 
style="font-size: small;">I'm not sure if it's just our bad luck, but the 
majority  of the apartments and hotels we've stayed at in Europe did not have  
shower curtains around the bath tub. We've run into this in several  places in 
Germany, Hungary and Poland. Do Europeans not shower? Or do they somehow 
magically manage to do it without getting the entire bathroom soaked? 

## <span style="font-size: large;">2. Bug nets 
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="12" 
class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; 
text-align: center;"> <td style="text-align: center;">[<img border="0" 
height="320"

<td style="text-align: center;">[<img border="0" height="320" 
src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IXwRp_ihfmE/TDwN0lR0VxI/AAAAAAAAIkk/Krlyk9aVbKM/s320/IMG_8374.JPG"

/>](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IXwRp_ihfmE/TDwN0lR0VxI/AAAAAAAAIkk/Krlyk9aVbKM/s1600/IMG_8374.JPG) 
 <td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Beautiful apartment... <td 
class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">But no bug nets on any of the 
windows  <span style="font-size: small;">All the apartments and hotels we've 
stayed at in Europe are fairly modern, except for one thing: they have yet to 
discover the bug net. Maybe all the smoking they do (see #5) keeps the bugs 
away, but every time I crack open a window, I have to worry about getting 
eaten alive by mosquitos. 
<span style="font-size: small;"> 

## <span style="font-size: large;">3. Water 
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[<img 
border="0" height="270" 
src="http://images.wikia.com/analytical/images/6/67/Waterbottle.jpg" 
width="320" 
/>](http://images.wikia.com/analytical/images/6/67/Waterbottle.jpg) 
<span style="font-size: large;"><span style="font-size: small;">Europeans love 
to drink, so long as it's not water. They serve up [incredible 
beer](https://picasaweb.google.com/brikis98/MunichFoodDrink#5214051885492727906) 
by the liter, but order water at a restaurant and you get a weird look. 
Moreover, it's never clear if the tap water is safe to drink, so no trip to 
Europe is complete without a daily stop at the convenience store for some 
bottled water. 

## <span style="font-size: large;">4. Customer service 

<div style="text-align: center;">[<img alt="Dilbert.com" border="0" 
height="123" 
src="http://dilbert.com/dyn/str_strip/000000000/00000000/0000000/000000/80000/9000/500/89597/89597.strip.gif" 
width="400" />](http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2010-05-15/) 
<span style="font-size: small;">In the US, the customer is always right; in 
Europe, the customer is an obstacle to a quiet day. The combination of jobs 
from which you can't be fired (e.g. various government functionaries), the 
fact that the tip is usually included in the bill, and a general disdain for 
Americans, means that the customer service you get in Europe may not be quite 
as friendly, smiling, and helpful as you'd expect. And don't bother asking for 
a manager: they almost always side with the employee. 

<span style="font-size: large;">**5. Smoking** 

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[<img 
border="0" height="216" 
src="http://www.tobacco-news.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/deter-smoking.jpg" 
width="320" 
/>](http://www.tobacco-news.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/deter-smoking.jpg) 
<span style="font-size: small;">This is by far my biggest annoyance with 
Europe. For a part of the world that is generally very modern, progressive and 
environmentally and health conscious, they sure do love their cigarettes. 
Everyone smokes and they do it everywhere. You have to make a special effort 
to get a non-smoking room, non-smoking cabin, non-smoking rental car, and sit 
in the non-smoking part of the restaurant. And despite all that, my clothes 
still end up smelling like an ash tray after every trip.   ** **
