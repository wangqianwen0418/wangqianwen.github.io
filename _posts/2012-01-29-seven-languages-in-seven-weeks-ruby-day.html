I recently picked up a copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</a>&nbsp;by Bruce A Tate. The book is a survey of seven very different programming languages: Ruby, IO, Prolog, Scala, Erlang, Clojure, and Haskell.&nbsp;For each language, the goal is to give you just enough of a taste that you can see what makes it&nbsp;unique, what its strengths and weaknesses are, and the mindset and philosophy behind it.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Seven-Languages-Weeks-Programming-Programmers/dp/193435659X" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="200" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LEqb3ctyDHA/TyWo3qOwgfI/AAAAAAAAKWU/9z6_5bsTg_o/s200/seven-languages.jpg" width="166" /></a></div><br />Each section of the book focuses on a different language and includes coding problems for the reader to try at home. I've decided to record my my solutions to the problems and thoughts about each language in my blog. Today, we'll start with <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a>.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Ruby, Day 1: Thoughts</b></span><br /><br />I've used <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/">Ruby</a> fairly extensively the last few years, including several&nbsp;<a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> apps (<a href="http://resume.linkedinlabs.com/">Resume Builder</a>, <a href="http://veterans2011.linkedin.com/">Veterans Hackday</a>) and a number of utility scripts. There is a lot to like about Ruby - the concise &amp; clean syntax, incredible flexibility, expressiveness, powerful DSLs - but my favorite part is the central tennet of the language, as expressed by its creator:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i>"Ruby is designed to make programmers happy."</i>&nbsp;Yukihiro Matsumoto</blockquote>The language isn't built for speed, concurrency, or any particular feature set. Its central "success metric" is programmer happiness and productivity, which are, arguably, the biggest bottlenecks in most projects.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Ruby, Day 1: Problems</b></span><br /><br />The "Day 1" Ruby chapter focused on the very basics of the language, so I didn't learn anything new. The problems are extremely simple and basic, but for completeness, here are my solutions:<br /><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Hello, World</b></span><br />Print the string "Hello, world". <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1700592.js?file=hello_world.rb"></script><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Hello, Ruby</b></span><br />For the String "Hello, Ruby", find the index of the word "Ruby". <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1700592.js?file=hello_ruby.rb"></script><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Print Name</b></span><br />Print your name ten times. <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1700592.js?file=print_name.rb"></script><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Print Sentence</b></span><br />Print the string "This is sentence number 1" where the number 1 changes from 1 to 10. <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1700592.js?file=print_sentence.rb"></script><br /><span style="font-size: large;"><b>Random Number</b></span><br />Write a program that picks a random number. Let a player guess the number, telling the player whether the guess is too high or too low. <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1700592.js?file=guess_number.rb"></script><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Ruby vs. Java</b></span><br /><br />Coming from a Java background, every time I see Ruby, I'm amazed at how concise and readable it is. There is far less boilerplate: you don't have to wrap everything in classes and methods, no semi-colons, far fewer curly braces, and so on. Everything is an object and there are countless helper functions, all with intuitive names: even if you've never used Ruby, it's easy to guess the effects of 10.times or 1.upto(10). Whereas in the Java world, libraries seem to compete on having every bell, whistle, and tuning knob, in the Ruby world, libraries focus much more on having the simplest, easiest, one-line-and-you're-done API possible.<br /><br />For comparison, I implemented the number guessing game in Java: <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1700592.js?file=GuessNumber.java"></script><br />It's has more than&nbsp;<i>twice</i>&nbsp;the number of lines of code as the Ruby version (and I kept opening curly braces on the same line!) and even though I've been doing Java for a very long time, it still took longer to write. Of course, there are many other trade-offs at play here, but they key thing to think about is the golden rule of programming:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"<i>Programs must be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute.</i>"&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Structure-Interpretation-Computer-Programs-Engineering/dp/0262011530">SICP</a></blockquote>Ruby has its downsides, but it is one of the best languages I've seen for writing code that others can read, understand, and maintain for a long time after. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Ruby, Continued</b></span><br /><br />The Ruby explorations continue on&nbsp;<a href="http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2012/01/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks-ruby-day_29.html">Ruby, Day 2</a>.
