In my <a href="http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2012/01/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks-ruby-day.html">previous post</a>, I went through the <a href="http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2012/01/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks-ruby-day.html">Day 1 Ruby problems</a> from <a href="http://brikis98.blogspot.com/search/label/Seven%20Languages%20in%20Seven%20Weeks">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</a>. Today, I'll share my solutions to the Day 2 problems and some more thoughts about Ruby.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Ruby, Day 2: Thoughts</b></span><br /><br />I originally learned Ruby (and many other programming languages) the "hacker way": that is, I did a 10 minute syntax tutorial, browsed other peoples' code a bit, and then just started using the language, looking up missing pieces as I went. Although this is the most fun and productive way I've found to get started with a language, it can also lead to missing some of the finer points and subtleties.<br /><br />For example, until the "Ruby, Day 2" chapter, I never had a full appreciation for Ruby code blocks and the yield keyword. For example, even though I frequently used "<a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Integer.html#method-i-times">times</a>" to do looping, I never thought deeply about how it worked:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1700592.js?file=print_name.rb"></script><br />It turns out that times is just a function (slightly obscured because Ruby doesn't require parentheses for function calls) on the Integer class that takes a code block as an argument. Times could be implemented as follows: <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1700969.js?file=custom_times.rb"></script><br />This style of coding allows for some powerful possibilities. For example, it is surprisingly easy to introduce a "do in a transaction" function: <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1700969.js?file=transaction_wrapper.rb"></script><br />Using this, I can now trivially wrap any number of statements in a transaction: <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1700969.js?file=transaction.rb"></script><br />The equivalent in less expressive languages, such as Java, often involves vastly more code, implementing arbitrary interfaces, anonymous inner classes, and a lot of very hard-to-read code. For comparison, here is an example of how Java's <a href="http://www.springsource.org/">Spring Framework</a> recommends wrapping <a href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jdbc.html">JDBC code in transactions</a>:<br /><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1700969.js?file=SpringTransaction.java"></script><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Ruby, Day 2: Problems</b></span><br /><br />The Day 2 problems are only slightly tougher than Day 1. The most fun part was coming up with a way to keep the code as concise as possible.<br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: large;">Print 16</span></b><br />Print the contents of an Array of 16 numbers, 4 numbers at a time, using just "each". Now, do the same with "each_slice" in <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.8.7/Enumerable.html">Enumerable</a>. <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1700969.js?file=each_16.rb"></script><script src="https://gist.github.com/1700969.js?file=each_slice_16.rb"></script><br /><b><span style="font-size: large;">Tree</span></b><br />Modify the Tree class initializer (original code <a href="https://gist.github.com/1700969#file_tree_original.rb">here</a>) so it can accept a nested structure of Hashes. Trickiest part here was that the "collect" function can call the passed in block with either one argument that's an Array or two arguments that represent the (key, value) pair. <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1700969.js?file=tree_new.rb"></script><br /><b><span style="font-size: large;">Grep</span></b><br />Write a simple grep that will print the lines and line numbers of a file having any occurrence of a phrase anywhere in that line. <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1700969.js?file=grep.rb"></script><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Ruby vs. Java, Round 2 </b></span><br /><br />I couldn't resist implementing the grep code in Java to see how it compares: <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/1700969.js?file=Grep.java"></script><br />It's <b>33 lines long</b>. The Ruby solution was a one-liner.<br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Ruby, Continued</span></b><br /><b><br /></b><br />Check out more Ruby goodness on <a href="http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2012/01/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks-ruby-day_31.html">Ruby, Day 3</a>.
