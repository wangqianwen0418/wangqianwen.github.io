After a bumpy start with&nbsp;<a href="http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2012/03/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks-scala.html">Scala on Day 1</a>, I've moved onto the second day of Scala in <a href="http://brikis98.blogspot.com/search/label/Seven%20Languages%20in%20Seven%20Weeks">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</a>.<br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Scala, Day 2: Thoughts</span></b><br /><br />The second Scala chapter shifts gears to functional programming. Unfortunately, I was impatient on Day 1 and had already looked up all of these concepts (and some more) to build a <a href="https://gist.github.com/2069380#file_tic_tac_toe.scala">Tic Tac Toe game</a>. As a result, I breezed through the chapter.<br /><br />On a side note, I was using Scala on a personal project and rewrote some Java code using Scala. As much as I complained yesterday about Scala's complexity, the slow compiler, and poor IDE support, I must admit one thing: the resulting code was <i>noticeably</i> cleaner, shorter, and easier to read.<br /><br />The language is certainly not perfect, but I need to make sure I'm not missing the forrest for the trees: it's still likely a vastly superior alternative to Java.<br /><br /><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Scala, Day 2: Problems</span></b><br /><br />The functional programming problems in this chapter were extremely simple. I burned through them in a few minutes and present the code without further comment:<br /><br /><b>String foldLeft</b><br /><br />Use <i>foldLeft </i>to compute the total size of a List of Strings. <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/2099982.js?file=SumStrings.scala"></script><br /><b>Censorship</b><br /><br />Write a <i>Censor</i>&nbsp;trait with a method that will replace "curse" words with "clean" alternatives. Read the curse words and alternatives from a file and store them in a Map. <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/2099982.js?file=Censor.scala"></script><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/2099982.js?file=censor.txt"></script><br /><b><span style="font-size: x-large;">On to day 3 </span></b><br /><br />Learn about pattern matching and actors in <a href="http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2012/04/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks-scala.html">Scala, Day 3</a>.
