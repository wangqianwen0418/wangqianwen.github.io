After a long hiatus, I'm finally back to working my way through <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks">Seven Languages in Seven Weeks</a>. After finishing up <a href="http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2012/03/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks-scala.html">Scala</a>, I'm now on the 5th language, Erlang, though it has taken me quite a bit longer than 5 weeks to get here.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Erlang, Day 1: Thoughts</b></span><br /><br />The first Erlang chapter is just a gentle introduction to the language, so I haven't formed much of an impression of it yet. So far, it looks like a dynamically typed functional programming language with Prolog syntax and pattern matching. Of course, I mostly know of Erlang for its concurrency story, so I'm excited to experiment with that in later chapters.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Erlang, Day 1: Problems</b></span><br /><br /><b>Write a function that uses recursion to return the number of words in a string</b><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4015032.js?file=word_count.erl"></script> <b>Write a function that uses recursion to count to ten</b><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4015032.js?file=count_to_ten.erl"></script> <b>Write a function that uses matching to selectively print "success" or "error: message" given input of the form {error, Message} or success</b><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/4015032.js?file=error_or_success.erl"></script> <span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>On to day 2</b></span><br /><br />Check out <a href="http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2012/11/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks-erlang_4.html">Erlang, Day 2</a>, for more functional programming goodness.
