After a long hiatus, I'm finally back to working my way through [Seven 
Languages in Seven 
Weeks](http://pragprog.com/book/btlang/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks). After 
finishing up 
[Scala](http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2012/03/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks-scala.html), 
I'm now on the 5th language, Erlang, though it has taken me quite a bit longer 
than 5 weeks to get here. 

<span style="font-size: x-large;">**Erlang, Day 1: Thoughts** 

The first Erlang chapter is just a gentle introduction to the language, so I 
haven't formed much of an impression of it yet. So far, it looks like a 
dynamically typed functional programming language with Prolog syntax and 
pattern matching. Of course, I mostly know of Erlang for its concurrency 
story, so I'm excited to experiment with that in later chapters. 

<span style="font-size: x-large;">**Erlang, Day 1: Problems** 

## Write a function that uses recursion to return the number of words in a 
string 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/4015032.js?file=word_count.erl"></script> 
**Write a function that uses recursion to count to ten** 

<script 
src="https://gist.github.com/4015032.js?file=count_to_ten.erl"></script> 
**Write a function that uses matching to selectively print "success" or 
"error: message" given input of the form {error, Message} or success** 

<script 
src="https://gist.github.com/4015032.js?file=error_or_success.erl"></script> 
<span style="font-size: x-large;">**On to day 2** 

Check out [Erlang, Day 
2](http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2012/11/seven-languages-in-seven-weeks-erlang_4.html), 
for more functional programming goodness.
