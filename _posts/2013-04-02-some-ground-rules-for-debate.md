For some reason, you've gotten into a debate with me about philosophy, 
software, psychology, history, life, the universe, and everything. Awesome! 

Before we go any further, let's lay down a few ground rules to help ensure 
that we don't waste each other's time. 

<span style="font-size: x-large;">**Rule 1: cogito ergo sum** 

If we debate long enough, it's possible that we'll become unhinged from 
reality and start to question *everything*. Perhaps the world is not what it 
seems. Maybe our senses are lying to us. What if this is all a dream? What if 
you're a figment of my imagination or I'm a figment of yours? 

If we get to this point, we need to stop immediately, and back up. 

All arguments boil down to just a single truth: 
<div style="text-align: center;"><blockquote class="tr_bq"><i 
style="text-align: center;">I think, therefore I am.</i><span 
style="text-align: center;"> - Ren√© Descartes</blockquote>Unfortunately, this 
is not a particularly useful result. If we're going to have a debate, we need 
more than that. 
<table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" 
class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; 
text-align: center;"><td style="text-align: center;">[<img border="0"

class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">I am, therefore I thinkEven 
though I can't prove it, I'm going to *assume* that there is some sort of real 
world out there; that there isn't a robot deity keeping my brain trapped in a 
computer simulation; that my senses aren't lying to me all the time. I'm going 
to assume that the world is, more or less, what it seems, and our role is 
merely to do our best to adapt to it. 

If we can't agree to these axioms, then we shouldn't waste any more time 
debating. If "I think, therefore I am" is the *only* thing you're willing to 
believe, then we won't make it very far anyway. After all, if everything is a 
lie, what could we possibly gain from a debate? 

<span style="font-size: x-large;">**Rule 2: theories and models** 
<div> 
<div>Although I'll rely on some axioms as the basis for my reality, most of my 
claims will come from *theories*. I put this word in italics because it needs 
some explanation.<div> 
<div>Outside of a scientific context, the word theory often means that 
something is uncertain or unproven. For example, people like to criticize the 
theory of evolution by saying "it's *only* a theory." <div> 
<div>This is an unfortunate mix-up because, in science, theory means something 
different. A theory is an explanation based on observation and experimentation 
that can be used to describe and predict something. <div> 
<div>In other words, a theory is a *tool* that you use. It is a *model* of 
reality that can be used to make predictions; whether or not the theory 
corresponds to some underlying truth about that reality is (almost) 
irrelevant.<div> 
<div>In fact, I'll go one step further: <blockquote class="tr_bq" 
style="text-align: center;">*All models are wrong, but some are useful. *- 
George E.P. Box</blockquote><div>Yep, all theories are wrong. And that's OK. 
For example, we know that the theory of gravity is wrong (see: general 
relativity); we know that Newton's laws of motion are wrong (see: special 
relativity); in fact, most of classical physics is wrong (see: quantum 
mechanics); there is a whole wiki page of [superseded scientific 
theories](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superseded_scientific_theories). 
Nevertheless, all of these theories have been and continue to be incredibly 
useful, providing the essential tools for building airplanes, bridges, 
computers, spaceships, and understanding the universe. 

The goal of a theory isn't to be right; after all, you can never *really* be 
right, as per rule 1. The goal of a theory is to be *useful*. The important 
question is not "is this theory correct" but rather, "does this theory let us 
make predictions about the world better than other theories"?<div> 
<div>For example, the theory of evolution by natural selection lets us make 
some good predictions about how plant and animal species came to be and what 
will happen to them in the future. It may be *only* a theory, but it's a very 
useful one. On the other hand, intelligent design doesn't match our 
observations, isn't useful for making predictions, and therefore not a theory. 

<div>So, when you and I debate, it's not worth debating axioms, so all we can 
really do is debate theories. And we won't debate them based on the merit of 
whether they are true or not, but whether they are more useful than other 
theories.<div> 
<div><b style="font-size: xx-large;">Rule 3: the most important 
question</b><div> 
<div>One final step before we can have a debate: you need to ask yourself a 
question. It's arguably the most important question in all of science, reason, 
and debate:<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;">*What would 
convince you that you're wrong?*</blockquote><div>Be honest. What facts, 
evidence, or events would convince you that your current stance in the debate 
is wrong? This question is the very basis of the scientific method.<div> 
<div>If there is not a single thing in the world that could convince you that 
you're wrong, then your stance isn't a theory, but an article of faith. And 
faith cannot be debated.<div> 
<div>What would convince an evolutionary scientist that the theory of 
evolution is totally wrong? That is, what would show that the theory of 
evolution is not a useful model? I can think of a few examples: discovering 
evidence that the earth was just a few thousand years old; observing a new 
species magically materialize with no connection to any other species; finding 
evidence that the entire fossil record is an elaborate hoax by the liberal 
media.<div> 
<div>What would convince someone who believes in intelligent design that they 
are wrong? As far as I know, nothing. Apparently, numerous [observations of 
natural 
selection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_selection#Examples_of_natural_selection) 
in progress, mounds of data showing the [earth is over 4 billion years 
old](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_the_Earth), an extensive fossil 
record, and countless examples of [unintelligent 
design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_poor_design#Examples) are 
not enough. This is yet another reason intelligent design is not a scientific 
theory and should not be taught as one in schools.

border="0" height="382" src="http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/wright_brothers.png" 
width="400" />](http://xkcd.com/106/) 
<div>As long as a debate is about faith instead of theory, it is largely 
pointless, since there is nothing that can change either party's mind. This is 
why it's so painful to debate topics like abortion, conspiracy theories, 
politics, and religion. 

Therefore, I propose that we only have a debate if both of us can identify, at 
least to ourselves, that there is at least one piece of evidence that could 
convince us that we're wrong.<div> 
<div><b style="font-size: xx-large;">Alright, let's do this</b><div> 
<div>Made it this far? 

Good. 

Because I'm ready to put on a clinic.
