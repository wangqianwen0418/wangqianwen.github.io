Just today, I got my 1,000th recruiter email in the last ~4 years. I know this is the number because I'm slightly&nbsp;<a href="http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2011/07/obsessed-with-lists-how-i-organize-my.html">obsessed with organization</a>&nbsp;and have added a specific label to each and every recruiter email I've gotten in my gmail account. Let's see: 365 days per year, minus 104 weekend days and, say, 10 vacation days, gives us roughly 250 working days per year.<br /><br />That means that, on average, 1 recruiter emails me every single business day&nbsp;<sup>[1]</sup>.<br /><br />There are a few take aways from this:<br /><ol><li>Being a software engineer is awesome&nbsp;<sup>[2]</sup>. We don't apply to jobs, they apply to us.&nbsp;</li><li>If you are a recruiter, you're up against some serious competition.</li><li>I've seen recruiter emails from every tech company you can think of. Some are comically bad.</li></ol>In this blog post, I'm going to share snippets from a few of the bad ones. Enjoy!<br /><br /><br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">[1] This doesn't even include the sketchy recruiters who track down my phone number and call me. If you do this,&nbsp;<i>everything</i>&nbsp;you say is shit.</span><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;"><br /></span><span style="font-size: x-small;">[2] I suspect that if kids had&nbsp;<i>any idea</i>&nbsp;how amazing it is to be a programmer in Silicon Valley, all of the problems US schools have with math and science would vanish overnight.</span><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><hr /><blockquote><br /><b>Subject: </b>Follow up<br /><br />Hi Yevgeniy,<br /><br />I’m not assuming you’re looking for a new roll right now but I wanted to follow up and gather your feedback. </blockquote><br /><div style="text-align: left;"><hr /><div style="text-align: center;"><i>Wrong!
