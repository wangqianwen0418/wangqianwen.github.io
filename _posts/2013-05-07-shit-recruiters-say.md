Just today, I got my 1,000th recruiter email in the last ~4 years. I know this 
is the number because I'm slightly [obsessed with 
organization](http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2011/07/obsessed-with-lists-how-i-organize-my.html) 
and have added a specific label to each and every recruiter email I've gotten 
in my gmail account. Let's see: 365 days per year, minus 104 weekend days and, 
say, 10 vacation days, gives us roughly 250 working days per year. 

That means that, on average, 1 recruiter emails me every single business day 
<sup>[1]</sup>. 

There are a few take aways from this: 
1. Being a software engineer is awesome <sup>[2]</sup>. We don't apply to 
jobs, they apply to us. 
1. If you are a recruiter, you're up against some serious competition. 
1. I've seen recruiter emails from every tech company you can think of. Some 
are comically bad. 
In this blog post, I'm going to share snippets from a few of the bad ones. 
Enjoy! 



<span style="font-size: x-small;">[1] This doesn't even include the sketchy 
recruiters who track down my phone number and call me. If you do this, 
*everything* you say is shit. 
<span style="font-size: x-small;"> 
<span style="font-size: x-small;">[2] I suspect that if kids had *any idea* 
how amazing it is to be a programmer in Silicon Valley, all of the problems US 
schools have with math and science would vanish overnight.

Hi Yevgeniy, 

happy valentine's day! 
hope this new year has provided time for some fun activities. 
our family started off the new year attending a terrific concert a couple of 
weeks ago. the performance reinforced the experience of music as a true 
combination of four creative forces (composer, conductor, musician and 
audience) in communicating ideas, thoughts &amp; feeling. we were fortunate to 
hear pieces from Wagner, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Leonard Bernstein to Holst. 
an awesome introduction to the symphony for kids! 

if you might have time for a quick chat, i'd like to share a principal-level 
swe opportunity:</blockquote>
