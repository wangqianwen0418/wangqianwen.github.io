At LinkedIn, <a href="http://engineering.linkedin.com/play/play-framework-linkedin">we've started to use the Play Framework</a>, which supports not only Java, but also Scala. Many teams have opted to write their apps in Scala, so I've spent a fair amount of time helping team members learn the language.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SLIrkeD61RM/UaiAl5RIxLI/AAAAAAAAM-E/L4OspA2FZAs/s1600/scala-logo.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SLIrkeD61RM/UaiAl5RIxLI/AAAAAAAAM-E/L4OspA2FZAs/s1600/scala-logo.png" /></a></div><br />Most LinkedIn engineers are proficient in Java, so their early Scala code looks like a literal translation from Java to Scala: lots of for-loops, mutable variables, mutable collection classes, null values, and so on. While this code <i>works</i>, it's not taking advantage of one of Scala's biggest strengths: strong support for functional programming.<br /><br />In this post, I want to share 10 recipes for how to translate a few of the most common imperative Java patterns into functional Scala code.<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Why functional programming?</b></span><br /><br />Why would you want to make your code "functional"? This question has been asked and answered many times, so rather than recreating the answers myself, I'll point you to a couple good starting points:<br /><ol><li><a href="http://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/dat/miranda/whyfp90.pdf">Why Functional Programming Matters</a>&nbsp;by John Hughes</li><li><a href="http://michaelochurch.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/functional-programs-rarely-rot/">Functional Programs Rarely Rot</a> by Michael O. Church</li></ol>It's worth mentioning that Scala is <i>not</i> a pure functional language, but it is still worth trying to make as much of your code as possible out of (a) small functions that (b) use only immutable state and (c) are side effect free. If you do that, I believe your code will generally be easier to read, reason about, and test.<br /><br />Now, on to the cookbook!<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Recipe 1: building a list</b></span><br /><br />Let's start easy: we want to loop over a List of data, process each item in some way, and store the results in a new List. Here is the standard way to do this in Java:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5683445.js"></script> It's possible to translate this verbatim into Scala by using a <code>mutable.List</code> and a for-loop, but there is no need to use mutable data here. In fact, there is <i>very rarely</i> a reason to use mutable variables in Scala; think of it as a code smell.<br /><br />Instead, we can use the&nbsp;<code>map</code> method, which creates a new List by taking a function as a parameter and calling that function once for each item in the original List (see: <a href="http://www.brunton-spall.co.uk/post/2011/12/02/map-map-and-flatmap-in-scala/">map and flatMap in Scala</a> for more info):<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5683455.js"></script><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Recipe 2: aggregating a list</b></span><br /><br />Let's make things a little more interesting: we again have a List of data to process, but now we need to calculate some stats on each item in the list and add them all up. Here is the normal Java approach:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5683478.js"></script> Can this be done without a mutable variable? Yup. All you need to do is use &nbsp;the&nbsp;<code>foldLeft</code>&nbsp;method (read more about it <a href="http://oldfashionedsoftware.com/2009/07/30/lots-and-lots-of-foldleft-examples/">here</a>). This method has two parameter lists (Scala's version of <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/135">currying</a>): the first takes an <span style="font-family: monospace;">initial value</span> and the second takes a function.&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">foldLeft&nbsp;</span>will iterate over the contents of your List and call the passed in function with two parameters: the accumulated value so far (which will be set to <span style="font-family: monospace;">initial value</span>&nbsp;on the first iteration) and the current item in the List.<br /><br />Here is the exact same&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">calculateTotalStats&nbsp;</span>written as a pure Scala function with only immutable variables:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5683501.js"></script><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Recipe 3: aggregating multiple items</b></span><br /><br />Ok, perhaps you can do some simple aggregation with only immutable variables, but what if you need to calculate multiple items from the List? And what if the calculations were conditional? Here is a typical Java solution:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5683532.js"></script> Can this be done in an immutable way? Absolutely. We can use <span style="font-family: monospace;">foldLeft</span> again, combined with <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/120">pattern matching</a> and a <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/107">case class</a> (case classes give you <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/258">lots of nice freebies</a>) to create an elegant, safe, and easy to read solution:  <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5683557.js"></script><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Recipe 4: lazy search</b></span><br /><br />Imagine you have a List of values and you need to transform each value and find the first one that matches some condition. The catch is that transforming the data is expensive, so you don't want to transform any more values than you have to. Here is the Java way of doing this:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5684075.js"></script> The normal Scala pattern for doing this would be to use the&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">map</span>&nbsp;method to transform the elements of the list and then call the&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">find</span>&nbsp;method to find the first one that matches the condition. However, the <code>map</code> method would transform <i>all</i> the elements, which would be wasteful if one of the earlier ones is a match.<br /><br />Fortunately, Scala supports <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.collection.SeqView">Views</a>, which are collections that lazily evaluate their contents. That is, none of the values or transformations you apply to a <code>View</code> actually take place until you try to access one of the values within the <code>View</code>. Therefore, we can convert our List to a <code>View</code>, call <code>map</code> on it with the transformation, and then call <code>find</code>. Only as the <code>find</code> method accesses each item of the <code>View</code> will the transformation actually occur, so this is exactly the kind of lazy search we want:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5684093.js"></script><br />Note that we return an <code>Option[SomeOtherObject]</code> instead of null. Take a look at Recipe 7 for more info. <br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Recipe 5: lazy values</b></span><br /><br />What do you do if you want a value to be initialized only when it is first accessed? For example, what if you have a singleton that is expensive to instantiate, so you only want to do it if someone actually uses it? One way to do this in Java is to use <code>volatile</code> and <code>synchronized</code>: <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5684180.js"></script> Scala has support for the <code>lazy</code> keyword, which will initialize the variable only when it is first accessed. Under the hood, it does something similar to <code>synchronized</code> and <code>volatile</code>, but the code written by the developer is easier to read: <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5684220.js"></script><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Recipe 6: lazy parameters</b></span><br /><br />If you've ever worked with a logging library like <a href="http://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/">log4j</a>, you've probably seen Java code like this:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5684134.js"></script> The logging statement is wrapped with an <code>isDebugEnabled</code> check to ensure that we don't calculate the expensive diagnostics info if the debug logging is actually disabled.  <br /><br />In Scala, you can define lazy function parameters that are only evaluated when accessed. For example, the logger debug method could be defined as follows in Scala (note the <code>=&gt;</code> in the type signature of the <code>message</code> parameter):<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5684161.js"></script> This means the logging statements in my code no longer need to be wrapped in if-checks even if the data being logged is costly to calculate, since it'll only be calculated if that logging level is actually enabled: <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5684149.js"></script><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Recipe 7: null checks</b></span><br /><br />A common pattern in Java is to check that a variable is not null before using it:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5683739.js"></script>If you're working purely in Scala, and have&nbsp;a variable that might not have a value, you should not set it to null. In fact, think of nulls in Scala as a code smell. <br /><br />The better way to handle this situation is to specify the type of the object as an <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.Option">Option</a>. <code>Option</code> has two subclasses: <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.Some">Some</a>, which contains a value, and <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.None$">None</a>, which does not. This forces the programmer to explicitly acknowledge that the value could be&nbsp;<code>None</code>, instead of sometimes forgetting to check and stumbling on a <code>NullPointerException</code>.<br /><br />You could use the <code>isDefined</code> or <code>isEmpty</code> methods with an <code>Option</code> class, but pattern matching is usually cleaner: <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5683775.js"></script><br />The <code>Option</code> class also supports methods like <code>map</code>, <code>flatMap</code>, and <code>filter</code>, so you can safely transform the value that may or may not be inside of an <code>Option</code>. Finally, there is a <code>getOrElse</code> method which returns the value inside the <code>Option</code> if the <code>Option</code> is a <code>Some</code> and returns the specified fallback value if the <code>Option</code> is a <code>None</code>: <br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5692280.js"></script><br />Of course, you rarely live in a nice, walled off, pure-Scala garden - especially when working with Java libraries - so sometimes you'll get a variable passed to you that isn't an&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">Option</span>&nbsp;but could still be null. Fortunately, it's easy to wrap it in an <code>Option</code> and re-use the code above:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5683788.js"></script> <br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Recipe 8: multiple null checks</b></span><br /><br />What if you have to walk an object tree and check for null or empty at each stage? In Java, this can get pretty messy:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5683803.js"></script> With Scala, you can take advantage of a <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/111">sequence comprehension</a> and <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/index.html#scala.Option">Option</a> to accomplish the exact same checks with far less nesting:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5683828.js"></script><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Recipe 9: instanceof and casting</b></span><br /><br />In Java, you sometimes need to figure out what kind of class you're dealing with. This involves some&nbsp;<span style="font-family: monospace;">instanceof&nbsp;</span>checks and casting:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5683993.js"></script> We can use <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/120">pattern matching</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/107">case classes</a> in Scala to make this code more readable, even though it does the same <code>instanceof</code> checks and casting under the hood:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5684007.js"></script><br /><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b>Recipe 10: regular expressions</b></span><br /><br />Let's say we want to match a String and extract some data from it using one of a few regular expressions. Here is the Java code for it:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5684026.js"></script> In Scala, we can take advantage of <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/node/112">extractors</a>,&nbsp;which are automatically created for regular expressions, and pattern matching using <a href="http://blog.bruchez.name/2011/10/scala-partial-functions-without-phd.html">partial functions</a>, to create a much more readable solution:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/brikis98/5684035.js"></script> <b><span style="font-size: x-large;">Got some recipes of your own?</span></b><br /><br />I hope this post has been helpful. It's worth noting that the recipes above are only one of many ways to translate the code; for example, many of the List examples could have also been done with recursion. <br /><br />If you've got suggestions on how to make the examples above even better or have some handy recipes of your own, leave a comment!<br /><br />
