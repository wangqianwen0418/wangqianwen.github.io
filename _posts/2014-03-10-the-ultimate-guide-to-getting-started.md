Are you trying to get started with the [Play 
Framework](http://www.playframework.com/)? Struggling to wrap your head around 
Futures, SBT, Scala, Functional Programming, or Iteratees? Then you've come to 
the right place. 

This post is a collection of the best resources I've found for getting started 
with Play. I've broken it down by category to make it easier to browse and 
jump to the topic you're most interested in. 

The list below is not meant to be comprehensive documentation, but rather, a 
collection of resources that cover the main areas where new Play users tend to 
get stuck. If you've got any great resources that are missing from the list 
below, leave a comment!
