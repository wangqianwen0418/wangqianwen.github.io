I love a good tech talk. I like to watch them, I like to <a href="http://ybrikman.com/talks.php">give them</a>, and now that I have lots of <a href="http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2014/04/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-t-shirts.html">free time on my hands</a>, I've put together a list of the must-see talks for every programmer. In this list, I've avoided language or library specific talks and instead focused on high-level, general topics that apply to everyone:<br /><ol><li><a href="#future-tech">The future of technology</a></li><li><a href="#ui">User interface</a></li><li><a href="#lang-design">Programming language design</a></li><li><a href="#sw-eng">Software engineering</a></li><li><a href="#learning">Computers and learning</a></li><li><a href="#career">A career in programming</a></li><li><a href="#gaming">Computer gaming</a></li><li><a href="#fun">Fun talks</a></li></ol><div>If I missed a talk you love, leave a comment. Happy watching!</div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b><a name="future-tech">The future of technology</a></b></span></div><div><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/gTAghAJcO1o" width="560"></iframe> <br /><div class="video-caption"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTAghAJcO1o">The Future Doesn't Have To Be Incremental</a> by Alan Kay</div><div></div></div><br /><div>When thinking about the future, you can't do better than <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a>. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gTAghAJcO1o">The Future Doesn't Have To Be Incremental</a>, Kay describes how Xerox PARC was able to develop so many new technologies in such a short time, including the personal computer, bitmap displays, GUI, desktop publishing, word processing, laser printing, Ethernet, and object oriented programming. The key was a culture focused on invention - that is, fundamentally new research - instead of incremental innovation. Invention requires a significantly higher investment of money, much longer time frames, and a different approach to problem solving ("wouldn't it be ridiculous if in 30 years we didn't have...").<br /><br />Other essential talks on the future of technology:<br /><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yJDv-zdhzMY">The Mother of All Demos</a> by Douglas Engelbart. A demonstration of hypertext, graphics, video conferencing, the mouse, word processing, and much more - all in 1968! This is the kind of leap frog invention Kay is referring to.</li><li><a href="http://worrydream.com/dbx/">The Future of Programming</a> by Bret Victor. A brilliant talk where Bret Victor takes us back in time and reminds us that "the most dangerous thought that you can have as a creative person is to think that you know what you're doing. Because once you think you know what you're doing you stop looking around for other ways of doing things and you stop being able to see other ways of doing things. You become blind." </li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKg1hTOQXoY">The Computer Revolution Hasn't Happened Yet</a> by Alan Kay. "I made up the term object-oriented and I can tell you I didn't have C++ in mind."</li></ul><br /><ul></ul><div><span style="font-size: x-large;"><b><a name="ui">User Interface</a></b></span></div><br /><div style="orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; widows: auto;"><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; clear: both; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: center; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"><div style="margin: 0px;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/36579366?byline=0" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="560"></iframe></div><div class="video-caption"><div style="margin: 0px;"><a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366">Inventing on Principle</a>&nbsp;by Bret Victor</div></div></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"><br /></div><div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"><a href="http://worrydream.com/">Bret Victor</a>'s talk&nbsp;<a href="http://vimeo.com/36579366" style="text-align: center;">Inventing on Principle</a>&nbsp;will make all of your programming languages and tools feel obsolete. He presents a new way to write code: a user interface that makes the computer do the tedious work so that you can&nbsp;<i>experiment with and</i>&nbsp;<i>react</i>&nbsp;to your code instead of trying to simulate it in your head. This not only makes it much easier to learn programming, it fundamentally changes how we go about solving problems.</div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"><br /></div><div style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; margin: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">More UI goodness:</div><ul style="-webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; color: black; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;"><li><a href="http://vimeo.com/64895205">Stop Drawing Dead Fish</a>&nbsp;by Bret Victor.

Another foundational talk by Hickey that will force you to reconsider state, time, identity, values, and types.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ahvzDzKdB0">Growing a Language</a> by Guy Steele. One of the most clever presentations I've ever seen on programming language design. Give it about 10 minutes - the payoff is amazing.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3kEfedtQVOY">The Science of Insecurity</a> by Meredith Patterson.

Ruby? Play Framework? Rails? TDD? Agile? Code reviews? Most of your answers are probably based solely on opinions, memes, trends, and anecdotes. <a href="http://vimeo.com/9270320" style="text-align: center;">What We Actually Know About Software Development, and Why We Believe It's True</a> is an important call to change our practices and move to a world of evidence-based software engineering.<br /><br />Other great talks:<br /><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NP9AIUT9nos">Real Software Engineering</a> by Glenn Vanderburg. Software engineering as it's taught in universities simply doesn't work. It doesn't produce software systems of high quality, and it doesn't produce them for low cost. Sometimes, even when practiced rigorously, it doesn't produce systems at all.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">Hammock Driven Development</a> by Rich Hickey. "Most of the biggest problems in software are problems of misconception." To solve hard problems, step away from the computer, take some time to think, and <a href="http://brikis98.blogspot.com/2014/05/you-are-what-you-document.html">write it down</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ROor6_NGIWU">The Language of the System</a> by Rich Hickey.

They created&nbsp;<a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>, which offers real university classes, online and for free, to anyone in the world. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6FvJ6jMGHU" style="text-align: center;">What we're learning from online education</a> talks about some of the techniques they are using to run classes of hundreds of thousands of students - including video, discussion forums, interactive UI's, automatic grading, and peer grading - and how this experiment is giving us unprecedented insight into how humans learn.<br /><br />A few other powerful talks on education:<br /><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTFEUsudhfs">Let's use video to reinvent education</a> by Salman Khan. Whereas Koller's talk is about university classes, Khan's talk is about online education for K-12 via the <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ia55clAtdMs">Teaching Creative Computer Science</a> by Simon Peyton Jones.

In this lecture,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming">Richard Hamming</a>&nbsp;shares his observations on "why do so few scientists make significant contributions and so many are forgotten in the long run?''&nbsp;Some of the key ideas include courage, luck, drive ("knowledge and productivity are like compound interest"), a focus on important problems ("If you do not work on an important problem, it’s unlikely you’ll do important work"), open doors, selling the work ("I suggest that when you open a journal, as you turn the pages, you ask why you read some articles and not others"), and much more.
