In literature, [The Competent (Wo)man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competent_man)
is a character who exhibits a very wide range of abilities and knowledge. The 
idea is similar to a Polymath or a Renaissance (Wo)man, and captured 
beautifully in this quote by Robert A. Heinlein:

<blockquote>
  <p>
    A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher 
    a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, 
    build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, 
    cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, 
    program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. 
    Specialization is for insects.
  </p>

One of my ambitions in life is to become a **Competent Programmer**. Today, I
came across a beautiful variation on Heinlein's quote that beautifully captures
this idea:

<blockquote>
  <p>
    A programmer should be able to find a bug, market an application, refactor 
    a spike, lead a team, architect an application, hack a kernel, schedule a 
    project, build a database, route a network, give a reference, implement 
    user stories, analyze user stories, work in a team, work alone, use 
    patterns, innovate, write documentation, have a real life, create a cool 
    website, email efficiently, resign gracefully, admit ignorance, and keep on 
    learning. Specialization is for recruiters.

I've never understood developers who describe themselves as a "PHP Programmer" 
or a "C++ Programmer". Libraries and programming languages are tools. It's OK to 
become an expert in one tool, but not at the exclusion of all others. If you're 
a developer, calling yourself a "C++ Programmer" is a bit like if you were a 
Carpenter and called yourself a "Hammer++ Swinger". It suggests a very limited 
tool belt.

It also suggests that you're missing the bigger picture. You don't hire a 
carpenter to swing a hammer. You hire a carpenter to build a house. Similarly,
you don't hire a programmer to build PHP apps or write C++. *You hire 
programmers to solve problems*. Some of those problems may require you to use 
PHP or C++, some of the problems need many languages at once, and many of the 
most important problems have nothing to do with the programming language at 
all, such as data modeling, system design, planning, testing, communication, 
and hiring. This is why I wrote a [book](http://www.hello-startup.net/?ref=a-programmer-should)
that teaches programmers not only to write code, but also come up with business
ideas, design products, figure out sales and marketing, define a company 
culture, and build a team.

Instead of a "Hammer Swinger", strive to be a "House Builder". Instead of "C++ 
Programmer" strive to be a "Programmer who has used C++ on project XXX". Instead
of a "C++ Programmer", strive to be a **Competent Programmer**.
