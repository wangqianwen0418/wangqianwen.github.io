To go faster in a car, you need not only a powerful engine, but also safety
mechanisms like brakes, air bags, and seat belts. This is a talk I did as part of
[NerdWallet's NerdTalks Series](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/corporate-news/nerdwallets-speaker-series-nerdtalks/)
where I discuss the safety mechanisms that allow you to build software faster.
