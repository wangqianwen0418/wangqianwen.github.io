[devRant](https://www.devrant.io/) is a place you can talk (or rant) about your life as a programmer with other 
programmers. The devRant folks are also putting together a series of podcast interviews. The first podcast was with 
[Andy Hunt](https://www.devrant.io/podcasts/episode-0-andy-hunt), author of *The Pragmmatic Programmer* and one of the 
founders of the Agile movement. The second podcast was with
[David Heinemeier Hansson](https://www.devrant.io/podcasts/episode-1-david-heinemeier-hansson-dhh) (DHH), creator of 
Ruby on Rails and co-founder of BaseCamp. The third podcast was with me:

I had a fun time talking about how I got into programming, biggest lessons I've learned in my career, biggest lessons
I've had to *un*-learn, DevOps, startups, and a whole lot more.
