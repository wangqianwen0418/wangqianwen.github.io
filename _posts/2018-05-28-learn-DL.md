In this post, I recommend some helpful resources for learning deep neural networks based on my learning experience. 

### lectures & textbook
The [standford cs231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) is a good start to learn CNNs.
The [cs224n](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) is about natural language processing with deep learning.

After finish cs231n and cs224n, I would recommend the [MIT deep learning book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/).

If you are interested in reinforcement learning, David Silver is a good teacher.
The videos of his RL cource is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pWv7GOvuf0)

### blogs  
Blogs usually simplified concepts to make them easier to understand.
Thus, they are more friendly to beginners.

Here are some high-quality blogs I have read about CNNs.

[A Beginner's Guide To Understanding Convolutional Neural Networks](https://adeshpande3.github.io/adeshpande3.github.io/A-Beginner's-Guide-To-Understanding-Convolutional-Neural-Networks/).
PS: the author was only 19 when he wrote this high-quality blog. Really impressive.  

[A 2017 Guide to Semantic Segmentation with Deep Learning](http://blog.qure.ai/notes/semantic-segmentation-deep-learning-review)  

[A Year in Computer Vision](http://www.themtank.org/a-year-in-computer-vision) is a good report about DNNs in CV.

[Review of Deep Learning Algorithms for Object Detection](https://medium.com/comet-app/review-of-deep-learning-algorithms-for-object-detection-c1f3d437b852)

### important models

two survey papers I like:  
[Recent Advances in Recurrent Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.01078)  
[Recent Advances in Convolution Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07108) 

There is a [github repo](https://github.com/RedditSota/state-of-the-art-result-for-machine-learning-problems) that collects the state-of-the-art results for machine learning problems.  

[DNN Genealogy](https://wangqianwen0418.github.io/projects/DNNGenealogy), an interactive visualization tool developed by our group, summarizes the milestone models in the development of DNNs.

The [Caffe Model Zoo](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo) is also a good place to look for DNN models. 



### Framework  
Don't start with tensorflow!    
Even though tensorflow is the most famous and popular machine learning framework, 
it is definitely not friendly to beginners. 

I would recommend [Keras](https://keras.io/layers/core/) and [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/).
{% include figure.html path="blog/DNN-resources/ranking.png" alt="ranking" %}

I like Keras because:  
a) it supports multiple backend engines, including TensorFlow, CNTK, Theano, and MXNet;  
b) it offers consistent and simple APIs that minimizes the number of actions required for common use cases.  

Keras offers [offical examples](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/examples), implementations of [popular models](https://github.com/keras-team/keras/tree/master/keras/applications),
and a number of [pre-trained models](https://keras.io/applications/).   

Also, in the community, almost all the state-of-the-art models have their Keras versions.
For example, [titu1994](https://github.com/titu1994) reimplements many famouse DNNs using Keras, including NasNet, non-local NN, mobileNet.
So, you can easily play with the state-of-art model using Keras.
