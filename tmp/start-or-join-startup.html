<p>If you’re considering taking a plunge into the startup world, one of the things 
you’ll have to decide is if you want to start your own company or work for
someone else. Here’s the basic trade-off between the two: as a founder, you will
have to make 10x the sacrifice in exchange for a <em>chance</em> of 10x 
the reward. By sacrifice, I mean you will be faced with an order of magnitude 
more of stress, risk, and long hours, and by reward, I mean that in exchange 
for this pain, you could earn an order of magnitude more money and reputation 
if you succeed. Founding a company is a very high risk, high reward game, 
and as most people are not equipped to handle that much risk—or, more 
accurately, the amount of stress that goes with it—most people should 
<em>not</em> be entrepreneurs, no matter what great ideas they have.</p>

<p>Even if you can handle the stress, there is another factor to consider. While 
writing this book, I came across a startling fact that completely changed the 
way I thought about founding a company. As a founder, <em>if</em> you get lucky
enough to build a successful startup (remember, the odds are roughly 
<a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443720204578004980476429190">1 in 4</a>),
it will take you, on average, 
<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/14/crunchbase-reveals-the-average-successful-startup-raises-41m-exits-at-242-9m/">7-8 years</a> 
to reach a successful exit (i.e. an acquisition or an IPO). For example, 
consider the age of some of the most successful startups of the last decade at 
the time of their exits: Facebook was 8, Google was 6, Twitter was 7, LinkedIn 
was 8, WhatsApp was 5, and Zappos was 10. Of course, it’s really 
only an “exit” for the investors—the founders will usually stay on at 
least a couple years more. So here’s the rule of thumb to take away from this:</p>

<p><strong>Only start a company if you’re willing to spend the next decade of your life 
working on it.</strong></p>

<p>If you’re 20 years old, you’ll be working on the company until you’re 30. If 
you’re 30, you’ll do little else until you’re in your 40’s. Once I heard this 
statistic, I went back to my list of startup ideas and threw half of them away. 
I realized that many of them were just “get rich quick” schemes at their core, 
and there was no way I’d be able to spend the next decade toiling away at them.</p>

<p>A successful exit isn’t the only reason to found a company—actually, 
hoping to get rich is one of the worst reasons to do anything related to 
startups—but so many people see startups as a get-rich-quick scheme that, 
if you take away nothing else from this blog post, remember this: building a 
startup probably won’t make you rich, and if it does, it won’t be quick. 
Success is rare, and when it happens, it takes on the order of a decade. </p>

<p>During that decade, you’re going to have to work very hard. Harder than
you’ve worked at anything else in your life. Any founder will tell you that 
bringing a new product into the market, changing user habits, and hiring the 
right people, all while making ends meet, is one of the hardest things you will 
do in your life.        </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    I think the hardest thing is that the success function is very discontinuous. 
    For example, you're trying for months to figure out how to accelerate user 
    growth. You try to introduce some features which you think will help make the 
    metrics go "up and to the right", but nothing really works. For ages, nothing
    happens. And then, suddenly, some massively successful thing happens totally 
    unexpectedly.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since you have no idea in advance where these discontinuities are going to be, 
    it seems then that the only reasonable behavior is to work really hard. You 
    have a finite length of runway, so if you can maximize the amount of stuff you 
    can get done, that maximizes the chance that you're going to hit that next 
    discontinuity before you die. And if you die before you get to that next 
    discontinuity, you know that you worked so hard that you couldn't have possibly 
    done anything else to get there faster.

</blockquote>

<p>Because the success function is very discontinuous, working at a startup, 
especially as a founder, is a bit like running a marathon with a blindfold on.
You know it’s a long race, but you can’t see the mile markers or a clock, so
you have no sense of how far you’ve gone, and you’re not even sure if you’re 
running in the right direction—but you can’t slow down and take a break,
or someone will surely pass you. So you keep chugging along as fast as you 
can, chasing after that next discontinuity.</p>

<p>For most programmers, joining someone else’s startup gets you 
<em>enough</em> of the benefit with far fewer drawbacks. In fact, rolling 
the dice on <em>several</em> startups is one of the best ways to have a 
fun and successful career as a programmer. If you start a company, the
odds that it’s the next Google or Facebook are very low, but as a founder, 
you’re committed, and you’ll have to stick with it for 5-10 years to find out. 
During that same time period, as an employee, you could join 3 or 4 different 
startups for a few years each, and significantly increase your chances of 
finding a successful one.</p>

    Valley entrepreneurs. Small slices of gigantic pies are still 
    themselves gigantic.

  </cite>
</blockquote>

<p>Just as there are lawyers who chase ambulances, there are engineers in 
Silicon Valley who chase IPOs and acquisitions. This isn’t a bad thing. 
These engineers hop from pre-IPO company to pre-IPO company and they 
contribute serious value to each one by building products and helping to 
scale the organization. In return, they get to develop a wide variety of 
skills, enjoy the unique culture at each company, accumulate some stock 
options, and, after a few years, they walk away with a ton of fun 
experiences under their belt and, in many cases, a fair bit of money in
their pocket.</p>

<p>If you knew which engineers to pay attention to, you could probably get 
pretty good at predicting which companies will soon have a massive IPO or 
acquisition. For example, in the last few years, I watched a few friends of mine
rotate through LinkedIn, Facebook, and Twitter, joining each company a 
few years before it had an IPO. How did they know? There are three primary
signs. First, look for products you and most people you know are already 
using. Most developers are “early adopters”, so if a lot of them are
flocking to a particular technology, there’s a good chance the rest of
the world will soon follow. Second, look for companies that have raised 
a lot of money through multiple rounds of financing. The more money 
invested, the more the investors will want to see big returns, and the
most common way to make that happen is for the company to go public or
get acquired. Third, look for companies that are growing at an incredible
pace and will need more money to sustain that growth until they become 
profitable. My guess at a few companies to watch in the next few years, at least 
based on their fundraising, growth, and recent developer migration patterns, 
are Uber, Airbnb, Square, Stripe, DropBox, Pinterest, PagerDuty, Slack, 
Zenefits, and GitHub.</p>

<p>If you’re more likely to get rich and have fun by joining someone else’s 
startup, is it ever a good idea to start your own? Yes: 
<a href="http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec01/">when you simply can’t <em>not</em> do it</a>. 
That is, the best reason to start a startup is because you are so passionate 
about an idea that you <em>must</em> bring it into the world. You’re doing it 
not for the fame or the fortune, but because it’s something
important enough to you that you are willing to go through all of the 
pain, risk, and sacrifice to make it happen. In the words of 
<a href="https://twitter.com/tonygaskins/status/240843461220253696">Tony Gaskins Jr.</a>,
if you don’t build your dream, someone will hire you to help build theirs.</p>

<p>Just make sure not to confuse the dream of accomplishing a specific 
<em>mission</em> with the dream of building a startup. Sometimes a 
startup is the best way to accomplish your dream, but in many cases, you’d be 
far better off starting a lifestyle business (e.g. a work-from-home consultant), 
or joining someone else’s company, or doing research at a university.
